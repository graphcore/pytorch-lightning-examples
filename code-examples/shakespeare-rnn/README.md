# Shakespeare RNN-LSTM example

This example showcases a RNN-LSTM model running on the Graphcore IPU, with PyTorch Lightning.
A custom mapping-style dataset is used which takes in a text file and splits it into chunks.

## Setup
To set up the script, first create a virtual environment and install the dependencies.
Note that `--force-reinstall` is required to make sure the installed PyTorch version is compatible with both PopTorch and PyTorch Lightning:

```console
python3 -m venv shakespeare-venv
source shakespeare-venv/bin/activate
pip install -U pip
pip install <path-to-poptorch-wheel>.whl
pip install -r requirements.txt --force-reinstall
```

Now enable the Poplar SDK:

```console
source <path-to-poplar-sdk>/popart-ubuntu_18_04-2.4.0+2529-969064e2df/enable.sh
source <path-to-poplar-sdk>/poplar-ubuntu_18_04-2.4.0+2529-969064e2df/enable.sh
```

## Instructions
Download the example Shakespeare text file from [the GitHub source](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karpathy/char-rnn/master/data/tinyshakespeare/input.txt) and name it as shakespeare.txt.

First pip install -r requirements.txt. Then to train on the Shakespeare data run:

    python3 train.py

To then generate new Shakespeare text run:

    python3 train.py --generate

To change the length of a generated sample use the option --length-to-generate.


For the other options:

`--temperature` - Changes the generation accuracy. A lower value makes the model pick more likely options from the distribution. Acceptable values are 0 to 1 excluding 0. Default is 0.5.

`--epochs` - Number of training epochs. Default is 500.

`--text-file` - The text to train on, default is shakespeare.txt.

`--length-to-generate` - The size of the text in characters to be generated. Default is 1000.
